* The 'mon_warn_osd_usage_min_max_delta' health warning has been disabled because
  it does not address clusters undergoing recovery or CRUSH rules that do
  not target all devices in the cluster.

* The OSDs now avoid starting new scrubs while recovery is in progress.  To
  revert to the old behavior (and do not let recovery activity affect the
  scrub scheduling) you can set the following option::

    osd scrub during recovery = true

-------

* The RBD C API's rbd_discard method and the C++ API's Image::discard method
  now enforce a maximum length of 2GB. This restriction prevents overflow of
  the result code.
